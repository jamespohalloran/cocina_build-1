Join us for yoga on the beachfront lawn on **Sunday, November 18, 2018 @ 10:00 am**!

Soraya Sanchez from [Dynamic Alignment Yoga](https://www.facebook.com/DynamicAlignmentYoga/) will teach free beginner's yoga from 10-11am. Plan to stay for brunch after class and receive a complimentary mimosa with the purchase of an entree!

This is our Gratitude-Themed class, thankful for al of our blessings. The class is open to kids, family and friends!

Don't forget to bring your yoga mat, a towel, lots of water, and sunscreen.
